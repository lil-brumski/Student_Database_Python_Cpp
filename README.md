**Student_Database**

* This project is mainly for improving on my C++ and Python knowledge. 

* It's supposed to be an admission system that admits students based on their qualifications.

* Run `$ pkg install clang cmake python` to download necessary tools for running this project.

* Download this project using `$ git clone https://github.com/lil-brumski/Student_Database.git` inside any working terminal/command line.

* `$ cd Student_Database_Python_Cpp/`

* `$ mkdir build/`

* `$ cd build/`

* `$ cmake ..`

* `$ make`

* `$ python Student.py`

* An `admission-list.txt` file will be automatically created in the parent directory. This file contains the admission list.

* Documentation is similar to that of the [C++-only version of this project](https://github.com/lil-brumski/Student_Database/tree/main/docs).

* Made by David Tamaratare Oghenebrume.
